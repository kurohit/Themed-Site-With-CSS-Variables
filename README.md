Customize your site using CSS Variables.  

Here, we'll update CSS variables with JavaScript.  

As soon as variables are updated, whatever property has the value of the CSS variable gets updated as well.  

When you click any of the buttons, they set the CSS variable to some other color. As a result of that, the background of the page is updated.
